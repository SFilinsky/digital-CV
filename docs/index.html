Personal projects and interests</h2> <p>Throughout years, I developed many things that pushed my improvement forward, but here's major one:</p> <h3>Tech project: Typescript game engine</h3> <p> I created <a href="https://github.com/worldscapes/engine">open-source multiplayer game engine</a> with <cv-tag>Typescript</cv-tag> in 2021-2022. </p> <p> During the work I tried many modern architecture approaches using state-of-the-art frontend tech: </p> <ul> <li> Dynamic high-frequency server-client communication that shared world update every few milliseconds with client as well as input with server </li><li> Using cutting-edge Typescript features I built a system to autocomplete query result usage based on its structure (simplified engine usage by far) </li><li> Functional reactive state management and simulation based on state-of-art <a href="https://www.simplilearn.com/entity-component-system-introductory-guide-article"> ECS game architecture</a> </li><li> Extensible design that allows using engine in any context - web, classic PC app or mobile </li><li> Used AssemblyScript for high-performance calculations </li></ul> <h3>Non-tech interests</h3> <p> Apart from programming, I have few main interests, which I deliberately worked on over the years: </p> <ul> <li>üéµ Music: I'm huge music enjoyer and for years was doing different things related to it - playing guitar (just at home and in a band), learned sound-engineering to record and mix my ideas and soundtracks.</li> <li>üéÆ Games and game development: I played tons of video games and my long-term pln is to create one in the future. Everything I do is dedicated to this goal, whether it's software development, better teamwork or making music and art.</li> </ul> </section> </main> <script src="bundle.js"></script></body> </html>
