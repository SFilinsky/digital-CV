        <h2>5. Personal projects and interests</h2>

        <p>Throughout years, I developed many things that pushed my improvement forward, but here's major one:</p>

        <h3>Tech project: Typescript game engine</h3>

        <p>
            I created <a href="https://github.com/worldscapes/engine">open-source multiplayer game engine</a> with <cv-tech-name>Typescript</cv-tech-name> in 2021-2022.
        </p>
        <p>
            During the work I tried many modern architecture approaches using state-of-the-art frontend tech:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li> Dynamic high-frequency server-client communication that shared world update every few milliseconds with client as well as input with server
            <li> Using cutting-edge Typescript features I built a system to autocomplete query result usage based on its structure (simplified engine usage by far)
            <li> Functional reactive state management and simulation based on state-of-art <a href="https://www.simplilearn.com/entity-component-system-introductory-guide-article"> ECS game architecture</a>
            <li> Extensible design that allows using engine in any context - web, classic PC app or mobile
            <li> Used AssemblyScript for high-performance calculations
        </ul>

        <h3>Non-tech interests</h3>
        <p>
            Apart from programming, I have few main interests, which I deliberately worked on over the years:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>🎵 Music: I'm huge music enjoyer and for years was doing different things related to it - playing guitar (just at home and in a band), learned sound-engineering to record and mix my ideas and soundtracks.</li>
            <li>🎮 Games and game development: I played tons of video games and my long-term pln is to create one in the future. Everything I do is dedicated to this goal, whether it's software development, better teamwork or making music and art.</li>
        </ul>
